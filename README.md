## Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a general framework to develop and test network slicing techniques for Wi-Fi networks. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11ax) indoor scenario. Multiple Stations (STAs) are connected to one Access Point (AP). A resource allocation algorithm can be tested in three steps:
* Configure the environment (number of Wi-Fi STAs, required throughput in each slice,...) through the interface script.
* Write in c++ a dynamic algorithm and define: the channel bandwidth, channel number, MCS, gi and tx power. The algorithm have access to run-time Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the network to take smart decision. There is no limit on the kind of algorithm which can be implemented, also Machine Learning (ML) techniques are supported.
* Finally, when the simulation time is over, the performance (throughput, losses and latency) is reported in a .csv file.

## Description

This repository contains Python codes which call the relative *ns-3* C++ scripts, simulating the considered Wi-Fi scenario.

To validate your own network slicing algorithm through simulations you will need to use the files ```run_wifi.py``` and ```wifi.cc``` properly configured.

Instead, you can reproduce the results presented in the paper "5G Network Slicing for Wi-Fi Networks" with the other files. More precisely:
* Launch ```run_wifi_1ch.py``` to reproduce the single channel approach. This file will call the ```wifi_1ch.cc``` *ns-3* script to simulate the today's Wi-Fi access technique, in which only one channel is accessed by all the STAs connected. We suggest to use this as a reference for the evaluation of your own original resource allocation algorithms.
* Launch ```run_wifi_static.py``` to reproduce the static network slicing approach. This file will call the ```wifi_static.cc``` *ns-3* script.
* Launch ```run_wifi_dynamic.py``` to reproduce the dynamic network slicing approach. This file will call the ```wifi_dynamic.cc``` *ns-3* script.

Furthermore, the ```csv``` folder contains the outputs of the simulations generated by ```wifi_1ch.cc```, ```wifi_static.cc``` and ```wifi_dynamic.cc```, in form of .csv files. In order to parse relevant information from them, three python scripts are available:
* Launch ```data_wifi_pe_lat.py``` to plot the packet error probability and the latency experienced in the three slices.
* Launch ```data_wifi_ptx_B.py``` to plot the transmission power utilized by the three slices. This is particularly relevant for mMTC devices, slice B in our paper.
* Launch ```data_wifi_se.py``` to plot the spectrum efficiency achieved in the three slices.

## Usage

In this section you can find detailed instructions on how to use our framework to validate your own network slicing algorithms through simulations in *ns-3*.

Execute the following steps to be able to use our codes:
* Install the *ns-3* network simulator following the instructions from its main website [nsnam.org](https://www.nsnam.org/).
* Download this repository as a .zip and extract it.
* Paste its content inside the ```scratch``` directory, which is inside the *ns-3* release directory.

Alternatively, you can download only the specific files you want to use and paste them in the ```scratch``` directory. Everything is now ready.

To launch a python script, for example ```run_wifi.py```, go in the ```scratch``` directory and type:

```
python ./run_wifi.py
```

Please, note that all the python scripts contained in this repository are written in python 2.7. Thus, you will need this version to run them. Before to launch ```run_wifi.py```, make sure to properly set all the options, including the ```ns3_script``` variable. Once launched, ```run_wifi.py``` will call ```num_seeds``` times the *ns-3* script indicated by ```ns3_script```, and will create a .csv file in which the output of the simulations will be registered.
